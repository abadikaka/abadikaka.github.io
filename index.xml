      <description>SwiftUI is very powerful for building an interactive UI at a fast pace. However, there are a couple of limitations still there such as some native API from UIKit like MKMapView from MapKit or search bar and other UIKit API. I will provide a tutorial for making a MapView in SwiftUI by using UIViewRepresentable as well as putting callback to the SwiftUI if we have clicked the annotation.

      <description>Have you ever heard about the problem that you need to separate two modules working independently without knowing each other implementation, but requires to be able to communicate easily by only sending necessary data? Most of the advanced use cases will face this real-world use case and we require a more advanced design pattern to be able to solve this pattern to give more scalability to the project. There is a general concept about “Wrapping” an object through an intermediary class that can adapt to each other.</description>
