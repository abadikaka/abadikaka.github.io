## WWDC Mentorship Week, organized by WWDC Community 2021.

During this WWDC 2021 week, I volunteered to help the community by giving a free mentorship and share my experience about working as an iOS Engineer to those who booked my sessions. I have succesfully mentored 12 student from Indonesia and 1 student from Malaysia.
