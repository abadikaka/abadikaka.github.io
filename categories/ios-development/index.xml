      <description>SwiftUI is very powerful for building an interactive UI at a fast pace. However, there are a couple of limitations still there such as some native API from UIKit like MKMapView from MapKit or search bar and other UIKit API. I will provide a tutorial for making a MapView in SwiftUI by using UIViewRepresentable as well as putting callback to the SwiftUI if we have clicked the annotation.
Some quick knowledge about several items below:</description>

      <description>Have you ever heard about the problem that you need to separate two modules working independently without knowing each other implementation, but requires to be able to communicate easily by only sending necessary data? Most of the advanced use cases will face this real-world use case and we require a more advanced design pattern to be able to solve this pattern to give more scalability to the project. There is a general concept about “Wrapping” an object through an intermediary class that can adapt to each other.</description>

      <description>Have you ever have a problem when designing a system that has a similar foundation and capabilities however the ingredients to form the object would vary? We may end up with an easy solution by providing different parameters for each subclass. However, multiple subclasses that need to override the constructor might also have to own those unnecessary properties into its interface. There is one design pattern that also considered as Creational Design Pattern which Android Design pattern by default having this pattern.</description>
